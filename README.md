# README

This is a repo for the Ruby programming project assigned by Arist to prospective candidates for the Software Engineer role at their firm. It is a Ruby on Rails API built for testing the deliverability of messages among varying carrier networks and message filtering criteria.

The full project description can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Deliverability-Analytics-API-Ruby-07e0e9eda66b48c582cb61a2c48815b5).

Tests are written for each endpoint using RSpec, and will require migrating the database in the `test` environment before executing `rspec`.
